/*
Given an array stock_prices, where the values in the array are the different prices of a stock in a given day, write a function that returns the highest profit that could have been made from buying and selling a stock that day.
Example:
stock_prices = [10, 7, 5, 8, 11, 9]

get_max_profit(stock_prices)
# Returns 6 (buying for $5 and selling for $11)

stock_prices = [11, 5, 7, 2, 9, 10]

get_max_profit(stock_prices)
# Returns 8 (buying for $2 and selling for $10)
